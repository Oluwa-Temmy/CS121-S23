**_[Pokemon Battle](https://github.com/Oluwa-Temmy/CS121-S23/tree/main/Projects/Project1)_**
Project 1 of 4

__A 2 Player pokemon battle game played in the terminal of the editor. When game is running the player is asked how
many rounds they would like to play. 
-The game will then iterate until the number of rounds entered is reached.

Player 1 and Player 2 are then asked for their pokemons name and abilities. 
-These values are saved into variables to be used in the while loop 

The player that has the highest attack speed will attack first. If both players have the same attack speed 
then a player will be chosen at random. 
-Players chosen with random int between 1 and 0

While neither player has 0 points the game will continue with each player damaging the opponents
health until a Player reaches 0 health.
-The player while loop is broken and the round is able to iterate to the next and starts the while loop again

Each round rewards the winner with 1 point, the player with the most round wins, wins the game.__
