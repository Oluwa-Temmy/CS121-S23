**_[Pokemon Battle](https://github.com/Oluwa-Temmy/CS121-S23/tree/main/Projects/Project1)_**
Project 1 of 4

A 2 Player pokemon battle game played in the terminal of the editor. When game is running the player is asked how
many rounds they would like to play. 
__-The game will then iterate until the number of rounds entered is reached.__

Player 1 and Player 2 are then asked for their pokemons name and abilities. 
__-These values are saved into variables to be used in the while loop__

The player that has the highest attack speed will attack first. If both players have the same attack speed 
then a player will be chosen at random. 
__-Players chosen with random int between 1 and 0__

While neither player has 0 points the game will continue with each player damaging the opponents
health until a Player reaches 0 health.
__-The player while loop is broken and the round is able to iterate to the next and starts the while loop again__

Each round rewards the winner with 1 point, the player with the most round wins, wins the game.
